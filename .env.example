# Internet Archive API Configuration
# This tvOS app uses Configuration.plist for API credentials
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy Configuration.plist.template to "Internet Archive/Configuration.plist"
# 2. Fill in your actual API credentials in Configuration.plist
# 3. NEVER commit Configuration.plist to version control (it's in .gitignore)
#
# Configuration.plist.template location: ./Configuration.plist.template
# Final plist location: ./Internet Archive/Configuration.plist

# Internet Archive API Credentials
# Obtain from: https://archive.org/account/s3.php
#
# Configuration.plist structure:
# <key>API_ACCESS_KEY</key>
# <string>YOUR_API_ACCESS_KEY_HERE</string>
# <key>API_SECRET_KEY</key>
# <string>YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY_HERE</string>
# <key>API_VERSION</key>
# <integer>1</integer>

# SECURITY NOTES:
# - User credentials are stored securely in Keychain via KeychainManager
# - API keys are loaded from Configuration.plist at app startup
# - Configuration.plist is excluded from version control
# - App Transport Security enforces HTTPS for all network requests
